# python-syslog_priority.py
This script is a simple Python script that calculates the facility code and severity level from the PRI value in Syslog protocol. The script prompts the user to enter the PRI value and uses bitwise operations to calculate the facility code and severity level. It then calls another function get_severity_info(severity) which maps the severity level to the appropriate severity name, keyword, and condition. It then uses the print() function to display the PRI value, facility code, severity level, keyword, and condition in a well-formatted way. This script makes use of the standard Syslog protocol format for the facility code and severity level.
It also allows the user to enter the PRI value and makes the script more interactive and user-friendly. The script is useful to understand the importance of Syslog protocol and how to extract useful information from the PRI value. This script can be used as a starting point to build more complex scripts that work with Syslog data
